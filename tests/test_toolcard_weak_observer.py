"""Behavioral tests for the base ``ToolCard`` weak-observer storage (Epic 22 / ADR-030).

The observer (owning agent) is held through a ``weakref`` so a tool, its closures,
and its command registry can never pin a stopped agent in memory. Access goes
through the ``_observer`` property, which derefs the weakref and raises
``ToolObserverGone`` once the referent is collected.
